# tclshlite

## What is it ?
This is a minimal implementation of TCL Language using STL ( Most of it.. ). Intention is not to really build a full fledge TCL Interpreter ( That would be unwise! ) but, to mainly focus on algorithms ( Recursive, Backtracking and so on.. ) that enables some of the basic features of tcl. And evetually learn in this process!.
